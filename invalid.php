		We're sorry! Your UCFID is not registered in the LINK database. This could be a couple of reasons.

	<h2>Is it the first week of classes?</h2>
	<p class="larger">
		We must wait until we have received the list of currently enrolled students after
		add/drop/swap week from the Registrar's Office before we can upload the information
		to the LINK database. Check back the second week of the semester and you will be
		able to view your LINK Loot.

	<h2>Are you a first year student?</h2>
	<p>
		The LINK program is only for first time in college (FTIC) students.
